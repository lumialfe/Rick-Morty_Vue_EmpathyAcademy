# Rick & Morty Search Page with Vue 3

This is the second exercise of the Frontend Path of the Acadamy Program of [Empathy.co](https://empathy.co/). In it we tried to replicate the page donde for [Exercise 1](https://github.com/lumialfe/Rick-Morty_EmpathyAcademy) using the Framework [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/).

The idea was to create a Web Page that, through calls to an [API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/), allowed the user to search for different characters, displaying their images and information in a responsive fashion.

## Deployment
