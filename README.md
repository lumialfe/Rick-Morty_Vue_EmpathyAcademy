# Rick & Morty Search Page with VueX

This is the third challenge of the Frontend Path of the Acadamy Program of [Empathy.co](https://empathy.co/). In it we tried to replicate the page done for [Exercise 1](https://github.com/lumialfe/Rick-Morty_EmpathyAcademy) using the Framework [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) and [VueX](https://vuex.vuejs.org/).

The idea was to create a Web Page that, through calls to an [API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/), allowed the user to search for different characters and episodes, displaying their information in a responsive fashion.

## Deployment

This page is currently deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://lumialfe.github.io/Rick-Morty_Vue_EmpathyAcademy/).
